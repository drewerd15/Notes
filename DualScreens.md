Monitors. 
2 monitors is a huge help for productivity, especially with zoom lectures. 
Important: look at what display ports you have on your monitor and what display ports your monitor will have!
The important things to look at are the:
- resolution (how many pixels you get), 
- what the delay is, if you want to game 1ms delay is prefered, if you aren't gaming 1-5ms delay is fine, 
- display type: OLED and LCDs look pretty good and are fast, IPS: looks excellent, good for art but often have a longer delay, Refresh rate: really only comes up for gaming, shoot for 120hz for gaming

My reccomendations: 1080p is the minimum resolution (1920x1080), I'm a fan of the extra wides, 1440p/QHD (2560 x 1440) They have a pretty good resolution good for having multiple windows open at once but don't require a lot of graphics card muscle to run. The next level up is 4k 3840 x 2160. 4k is like having 4 1080p monitors all connected. 4k displays are great but they can slowdown some computers and may not be worth it. For the most part unless you have a really beefy computer it will be hard to run games at a high framrate on a 4k dispaly. 

For the value I think the ultrawides are a good sweet spot. I have a Optix MAG321CQR as my main display, which I picked up for about $400, and it's totally worth it. 

Toms's hardware is a great place to start with reviews. [Best Computer Monitors 2021 \| Tom's Hardware](https://www.tomshardware.com/best-picks/best-computer-monitors)

For mounting I'm a big fan of monitor arms [Amazon.com: NB North Bayou Monitor Desk Mount Stand Full Motion Swivel Monitor Arm with Gas Spring for 17-30''Monitors(Within 4.4lbs to 19.8lbs) Computer Monitor Stand F80 : Electronics](https://www.amazon.com/North-Bayou-Monitor-Computer-14-3lbs/dp/B01AI2YGK4)
they let you position your monitor any way you want and free up space on your desk. Make sure the arm can handle the weight of your screen though.
Final notes, even if you have to pick up somehting crappy on the cheap I think it will totally be worth it and you can always get soemthing better later. Your monitor doesn't need a bunch of fancy features to display code.
