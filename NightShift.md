# Intro
I worked on night shift for about 8 months. Here is my advice for weird sleep schedules. 
The biggest rule is that bedtime is king. Go to bed at the same time and wake up at the same time every day
even on your days off. It is really easy to throw your schedule off by staying up late.
# Education
Watch these videos on sleep. Andrew Huberman who puts them together is very smart and does a great job 
describing how your brain works and what you can do to optimize your sleep. They are pretty long but I think they are worth it. The summary is to do your best to avoid light about an hour before your bedtime and get bright light in your eyes within 30 min of waking up, preferably sunlight. But the videos go into a lot more detail and are much better references. 
# Equipment 
Blackout curtains are curtains that are designed to block light. Eye masks are also great, get one 
that has foam around the sides, they block more light and are much more comfortable. 
Sound doesn't wake me up very easily but it makes it hard for me to fall asleep. Silicone earplugs are squishy like putty. These are the only kind you can wear all night without it hurting.
# Schedule
Normally I like to have my free time in the evening, so I would wake up at 7pm and go to work at 8pm then I would come home at 6am and go to bed at 10am. So my free time was in the early morning, but at the end of my day. After doing this for a while I shifted it so that my free time was before work, so I woke up at 3pm, had about 4 hours of free time, then went to work at 8pm. I would then go to bed immediately after getting home from work. I felt a big improvement in my mood, I also had more time to talk and hang out with friends and family. This worked for me but your experience may vary.
